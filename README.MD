# RAM

A Tensorflow implementation for ["Recurrent Attention Network on Memory for Aspect Sentiment Analysis"](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1047) (Peng Chen, EMNLP 2017)

## Quick Start

- Create three empty folders: 'analysis' for saving analyzing results, 'logs' for saving experiment logs and 'modelss' for saving experiment models 
- Download the 300-dimensional pre-trained word vectors from [Glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and save it in the 'data' folder as 'data/glove.840B.300d.txt'
